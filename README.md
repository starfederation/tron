# TRie Object Notation (TRON)

![TRON logo](assets/logo.png)

TRie Object Notation (TRON) is a binary format intended to be compatible with JSON primitives while using HAMT (for maps) and vector tries (for arrays) to support fast copy-on-write updates without rewriting the entire document. It targets wire use and embedding as a blob in a JSON column or KV store, not a full database or storage engine.

The name emphasizes the trie-based layout used for maps and arrays.

This repository hosts the evolving spec, documentation, and shared fixtures.

## Features

- JSON-compatible primitives (null, boolean, number, string, array, object).
- Canonical encoding: same logical value => same bytes.
- Copy-on-write updates with historical roots (append-only trailer).
- Random access without decoding the full document.
- Efficient map/array updates via HAMT + vector trie nodes.
- Stream-friendly: read nodes as needed from a byte slice.

## Status

Work in progress. Expect breaking changes as the spec solidifies.

## Benchmarks

GeoJSON fixture: `shared/testdata/geojson_large.json`. Command: `go test -bench . -benchmem -run=^$ ./...` (run in `../tron-go`) on AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX. Size columns are KB (1024 bytes); zstd uses default settings.

Note: TRON updates are copy-on-write. The modify benchmark only re-encodes nodes along the updated path, while full clone re-encodes the entire tree. Encode-only benchmarks start from a pre-parsed in-memory object (no decode cost). The TRON encode-only benchmark reuses a pooled builder, a dedicated encoder workspace for slice reuse, and appends the trailer in-place to avoid per-iteration buffer allocation/copies.

## Goals

- Represent all JSON primitive types (null, boolean, number, string, array, object).
- Support efficient random access and in-place updates via HAMT and vector trie nodes.
- Be deterministic and canonical for a given logical value (same bytes every time).
- Be streamable for reading without loading everything into memory.
- Keep the format simple enough for multiple implementations.
- Work well as a self-contained blob for transport or database/KV storage.

## Non-goals

- Compression (intended to be paired with streaming compressors like zstd or brotli).
- Schema validation or type enforcement (JSON Schema or other layers can sit on top).
- Arbitrary user-defined types (use MsgPack/CBOR for richer types; TRON stays language/type-system agnostic).
- Acting as a database or primary on-disk storage format.

## Inspiration

TRON was inspired by conversations with the lite3.io author. Those exchanges helped push a rebrand, but there was enough difference and friction in requirements that a distinct format was needed.

## Spec

See [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md) for the draft binary format and [`PRIMER.md`](PRIMER.md) for a HAMT/vector trie overview.

## Implementations

Implementation repos live external and can use `tron-shared` as a submodule for shared fixtures.

Note: `tron-rust` is in early development (see the `impl` branch); feature parity is still in progress.

Shared fixtures: add this repo as a `tron-shared` submodule to consume `shared/testdata` and `shared/metaschemas`.
